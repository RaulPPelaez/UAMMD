/* Raul P. Pelaez 2021
   At this point you have the necessary tools to construct and run a simulation using UAMMD.
   Just running the simulation is not very interesting, though. Typically we need to measure something from the simulation state or perform some kind of post-processing.
   In this tutorial we will see how to print particle positions to a file and how to measure the energy of each particle.

   We will start from the LJ liquid simulation we coded in a previous tutorial and will add a couple of functions to measure particle properties.
