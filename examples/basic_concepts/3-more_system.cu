   More about System.
   Besides its logging capabilities, System also provides a random number generator that can be used to seed other generators
   throughout the code.
   We will also see other things that System can do.

//uammd.cuh is the basic uammd include containing, among other things, the System struct.

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
  //Initialize System
  auto sys = std::make_shared<System>(argc, argv);
  //We can access the System's random number generator via sys->rng()
  //The first thing we should do is seed it with something controlled by us.
  //Since UAMMD modules will use this generator when in need of a seed, this will allow us to have deterministic runs.
  //Meaning that the same UAMMD code ran with the same seed will result in the same random numbers.
  //Besides numerical error, coming from the non-sequential nature of GPU execution, this gives reproducible runs.
  //If not seeded, System will initialize the generator using the current number of seconds since epoch.
  auto seed = 0x12345;
  //Alternatively, we could use C++'s random_device to seed differently each run:
  //std::random_device rd;
  //auto seed = rd();
  sys->rng().setSeed(seed);
  //This rng can generate numbers in several ways, lets see a few:
  //A number chosen among all the representable by uint (0 and 2^32-1)
  uint integer = sys->rng().next32();
  sys->log<System::MESSAGE>("An integer number between 0 and 2^32-1: %u", integer);
  //A number chosen among all the representable by uint64_t  (0 and 2^64-1)
  uint64_t long_integer  = sys->rng().next();
  sys->log<System::MESSAGE>("An integer number between 0 and 2^64-1: %lu", long_integer);
  //An uniform random number between 0 and1
  double uniform = sys->rng().uniform(0, 1);
  sys->log<System::MESSAGE>("An uniformly distributed number between 0 and 1: %.13g", uniform);
  //A normally distributed number with 0 mean and standard deviation 1
  double normal = sys->rng().gaussian(0, 1);
  sys->log<System::MESSAGE>("A normally distributed number with mean 0 and stdev 1: %.13g", normal);

  //System also allows to access the argc and argv passed at construction
  {
    auto argc = sys->getargc();
    auto argv = sys->getargv();
    sys->log<System::MESSAGE>("The name of this executable is %s, %d arguments were passed to it.", argv[0], argc-1);
  }

  //GPU memory allocation is really slow, for that matter System provides a C++ compatible GPU memory pool allocator.
  // This allocator caches queries to it, so multiple allocations/deallocations of similar sizes will be almost instantaneous
  // We will just mention it exists or now, though, and leave it to the advanced examples.
  // auto alloc =  sys->getTemporaryDeviceAllocator<double>();
  // thrust::device_vector<double, System::allocator_thrust<double>> vec(10000, alloc);

  //Destroy the UAMMD environment and exit
  sys->finish();
  return 0;
