/* Raul P. Pelaez 2022. Your first Integrator.
   In previous examples we used Integrators provided by UAMMD.
   You might want to define how particles are updated yourself.
   In this tutorial, we will define our own Integrator to do just that.
   If we follow the rules our Integrator will fit in nicely with the rest of UAMMD, allowing us to take advantage of, for instance,
   Interactors.

   For more information about Integrator see its documentation page. In this tutorial we will omit some advanced functionality.

// We start by defining a class that inherits from Integrator.
//This forces us to overload the required methods that any Integrator must provide.

public:

  //Let us start with the constructor which, at the very least, must take in a ParticleData instance.
  //Usually, an Integrator will also require some parameters in its constructor.
  MyFirstIntegrator(std::shared_ptr<ParticleData> pd):
    //The base class (Integrator) constructor must then be invoked with that pd and a name for our module
    Integrator(pd, "MyFirstIntegrator"){
    //Any initialization for our module also happens here
    this->someParameter = 1.0;
  }

  //The most important method we must override is forwardTime.
  //This function is in charge of updating "pd" to the next step in time
  void forwardTime() override{
    //Being an Integrator grants this class access to some useful members, in particular:
    // pd: The provided ParticleData instance
    // pg: A ParticleGroup (something we will discuss in future tutorials).
    // sys: The System instance assigned to this Integrator
    // interactors: A vector with all the Interactors that have been added to this Integrator
    // updatables: A vector with all the ParameterUpdatables (something we will discuss in future tutorials) that have been added to this Integrator
    //Lets use them all to forward the simulation.
    System::log<System::DEBUG2>("[MyFirstIntegrator] It is good practice to include debug messages when relevant");
    // We will implement some simple Euler Brownian dynamics update rule in the CPU with some hardcoded parameters
    //We will start by setting particle forces to 0:
    resetForces(); //Defined below
    //Then, we will invoke any Interactors that have been added to this Integrator to compute the current forces:
    computeCurrentForces(); //Defined below
    //Finally, we will use these forces to forward the simulation.
    updatePositions(); //Defined below
    //There is another part of the update flow that we should discuss.
    //It is related with the "updatables" member and the ParameterUpdatale UAMMD interface. You can read all about it in the documentation.
    //Mainly, it solves the problem of communicating parameters changes to anything that wants to be aware of them.
    //Note that Interactors are ParameterUpdatable by default.
    //So when an Interactor is added via addInteractor it will be available twice: As an Interactor in "interactors" and as a ParameterUpdatable in "updatables".
    //One common use for this is to communicate the new simulation time:
    this->steps++;
    for(auto u: updatables)
      u->updateSimulationTime(steps*dt);
    //There are a lot of update* functions (see ParameterUpdatable.cuh) to signal changes on different parameters.
    //For instance:
    // for(auto u: updatables){
    //   u->updateTemperature(newTemp);
    //   u->updateTimeStep(dt);
    //   u->updateViscosity(newVis);
    //   ...
    // }
    //Typically, you would use the first step to inform of any relevant common parameters of your Integrator,
    //such as the time step, temperature, etc, that other modules might be interested in.
