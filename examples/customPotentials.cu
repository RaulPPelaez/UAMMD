/*Raul P. Pelaez 2021.
Custom Potential examples showing the different computations the Potential interface can expose. Several Potentials of increasing complexity are available. 
A data.main.potentials file can be used to provide some parameters (it will be autogenerated if it is not present).

Potentials provide Transversers to PairForces in order to compute forces, energies and/or both at the same time. Many aspects of the Potential and Transverser interfaces are optional and provide default behavior, when a function is optional it will be denoted as such in this header.

The Potential interface requires a given class/struct to provide the following public member functions:
Required members:
 real getCutOff(); //The maximum cut-off the potential requires.
Optional members (at least one of the following must exist):
 ForceTransverser getForceTransverser(Box box, shared_ptr<ParticleData> pd); //Provides a Transverser that computes the force. 
 //If not present the force is computed using getForceEnergyTransverser.
 EnergyTransverser getEnergyTransverser(Box box, shared_ptr<ParticleData> pd); //Provides a Transverser that computes the energy
 //If not present getForceEnergyTransverser is used. 
 ForceEnergyTransverser getForceEnergyTransverser(Box box, shared_ptr<ParticleData> pd); //Provides a Transverser that computes the force and energy at the same time
 //If not present defaults to sequentially computing force and energy one after the other.
If there is no way to compute either force or energy it will be assumed to be zero. For example energy will be assumed to be zero if the only method defined is getForceTransverser.  
A struct/class adhering to the Potential interface can also be ParameterUpdatable[1].

The type(s) returned by these functions must adhere to the Transverser interface described below.
For each particle to be processed the Transverser will be called for:
  -Setting the initial value of the interaction result (function zero)
  -Fetching the necesary data to process a pair of particles (function getInfo)
  -Compute the interaction between the particle and each of its neighbours (function compute)
  -Accumulate/reduce the result for each neighbour  (function accumulate)
  -Set/write/handle the accumulated result for all neighbours (function set)
The same Transverser instance will be used to process every particle in an arbitrary order. Therefore, the Transverser must not assume it is bound to a specific particle.
   
The Transverser interface requires a given class/struct to provide the following public device (unless prepare that must be a host function) member functions:

    Compute zero(); 
      -This function returns the initial value of the computation, for example {0,0,0} when computing the force. 
      -The returning type, Compute, must be a POD type (just an aggregate of plain types), for example a real when computing energy. Furthemore it must be the same type returned by the "compute" member.
      -This function is optional and defaults to zero initialization (it will return Compute() which works even for POD types).
    
    Info getInfo(int particle_id);
      -Will be called for each particle to be processed and returns the per-particle data necessary for the interaction with another particle (except the position which is always available). For example the mass in a gravitational interaction or the particle index for some custom interaction.
      -The returning type, Info, must be a POD type (just an aggregate of plain types), for example a real for gravitation.
      -This function is optional and if not present it is assumed the only per-particle data required is the position. 
       -In this case the function "compute" must only have the first two arguments.

    Compute compute(real4 position_i, real4 position_j, Info info_i, Info info_j)
      -For a pair of particles characterized by position and info this function must return the result of the interaction for that pair of particles.
      -The last two arguments must be present only when getInfo is defined.
      -The returning type, Compute, must be a POD type (just an aggregate of plain types), for example a real when computing energy. 

    void accumulate(Compute &total, const Compute &current);
      -This function will be called after "compute" for each neighbour with its result and the accumulated result.
      -It is expected that this function modifies "total" as necessary given the new data in "current".
      -The first time it is called "total" will be have the value as given by the "zero" function.
      -This function is optional and defaults tu summation: total = total + current. Notice that this will fail for non trivial types.

    void set(int particle_index, Compute &total);
     -After calling compute for all neighbours this function will be called with the contents of "total" after the last call to "accumulate".
     -Can be used to, for example, write the final result to main memory.
      
    void prepare(std::shared_ptr<ParticleData> pd);
     -This function will be called one time in the CPU side just before processing the particles.
     -This function is optional and defaults to simply nothing.
