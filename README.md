## DESCRIPTION  

-----------------  

Raul P. Pelaez 2018-2022. (raul.perez(at)uam.es)  


A C++14+ header-only fast generic multiscale CUDA Molecular Dynamics framework made with moduarity, expandability and generality in mind. UAMMD is intended to be hackable and copy pastable.  

Although "Molecular Dynamics" is part of the name,the UAMMD framework allows for much more than that. To this moment multiple integrators are implemented allowing it to perform:  

	-Molecular dynamics (MD)  
	-Brownian Dynamics  (BD)  
	-Brownian Hydrodynamics (BDHI)  
	-Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)  
	-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)  
	-Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC)   
	-Lattice Boltzmann (LBM)(WIP)  
	-Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (coupled with particles with Immerse Boundary Method (IBM))  
		

Building blocks are provided for the user to construct a certain simulation. Most are highly templated to ease adaptability.  

For example, there is no harmonic trap module, but you can write a simple functor (directly in device code!) stating that each particle should experiment a force when it is trying to leave the box. Then you can pass this functor to the ExternalForces module. Similar things can be achieved with a bonded force, an interaction that needs to trasverse a neighbour list, an nbody interaction...   

Hop on to the examples folder for an introduction or check the [documentation](https://uammd.readthedocs.io) for more information.  


# Currently Implemented

See the documentation page at https://uammd.readthedocs.io for a full list of available modules.  

----------------------
## USAGE

-------------------

**UAMMD does not need to be compiled separatedly (it is header only)**.  

Some special flags might be needed to compile codes including with certain UAMMD headers, see [Compiling UAMMD](https://uammd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiling-UAMMD.html).  
Here you have a short example of how a typical UAMMD code looks like:  


```c++
//Ideal brownian particles
#include"uammd.cuh"
#include"Integrator/BrownianDynamics.cuh"
using namespace uammd;
int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
	int numberParticles = 1e5;
	auto pd = make_shared<ParticleData>(numberParticles);
	{
		auto pos = pd->getPos(access::cpu, access::write);
		std::generate(pos.begin(), pos.end(), [&](){ return make_real4(sys->rng.uniform3(-0.5, 0.5), 0);});	
	}
	BD::EulerMaruyama::Parameters par;
	par.temperature = 1.0;
	par.viscosity = 1.0;
	par.hydrodynamicRadius = 1.0;
	par.dt = 0.1;
	auto bd = make_shared<BD::EulerMaruyama>(pd, par);
	for(int i = 0; i<numberSteps; i++){
		bd->forwardTime();
	}
	sys->finish();
	return 0;
}

```

## DEPENDENCIES  

---------------------
Depends on:

	1. CUDA 9.x+                                :   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Some modules make use of certain NVIDIA libraries included with CUDA:
	
	1. cuBLAS
	2. cuFFT
	
Some modules also make use of lapacke and cblas (which can be replaced by mkl).  
Apart from this, any dependency is already included in the repository under the third_party	folder.  
See [Compiling UAMMD](https://uammd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiling-UAMMD.html) in the documentation for more information.
