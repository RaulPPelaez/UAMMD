About
======

UAMMD is a software infrastructure for complex fluids simulations for the GPU, presented as a CUDA/C++14 header-only library. UAMMD is intended to be hackable and copy-pastable.

Although "Molecular Dynamics" is part of the name,the UAMMD framework allows for much more than that. To this moment multiple integrators are implemented allowing it to perform:

- :ref:`Molecular dynamics` (MD)
- :ref:`Langevin Dynamics`  (LD)
- :ref:`Brownian Dynamics`  (BD)
- :ref:`Brownian Hydrodynamics` (BDHI)
- :ref:`Dissipative Particle Dynamics` (DPD)
- :ref:`Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics` (SPH)
- :ref:`Metropolis Monte Carlo` (MC)
- :ref:`Lattice Boltzmann` (LBM)(WIP)
- :ref:`Fluctuating Hydrodynamics` (coupled with particles with :ref:`Immersed Boundary Method` (IBM))

Building blocks are provided for the user to construct a certain simulation. Most are highly templated to ease adaptability.

For example, there is no harmonic trap module, but you can write a simple functor (directly in device code!) stating that each particle should experiment a force when it is trying to leave the box. Then you can pass this functor to the :ref:`ExternalForces` module. Similar things can be achieved with a bonded force, an interaction that needs to trasverse a neighbour list, an nbody interaction...

Hop on to the examples folder for an introduction or check the docs for more information.


.. important::

   **Compiling and running any code containing UAMMD requires a GPU and a system with a working CUDA environment**. CUDA is free and you can download it here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit

   On the other hand **understanding and modifying UAMMD code will require at least basic knowledge of GPU programming with CUDA**. There are a lot of resources online to learn CUDA, but you can start here: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/


If this is the first time you encounter UAMMD and want a quick start guide check the :doc:`QuickStart`. The :doc:`FAQ` is also a good source of knowledge.

Look in :doc:`Compiling-UAMMD` if some Makefile gives you troubles. UAMMD is a header only framework and it is mostly self contained in terms of dependencies so compilation should not be too troubling.


.. _basic-assumptions:

The four basic assumptions
=============================


.. figure:: img/sketchUAMMD.*

	    The basic conceptual hierarchy in UAMMD.


The foundational concepts of UAMMD are supported on a handful of (deliberately) vague assumptions which can be summarized in four:

.. rst-class:: centered

.. topic:: **1.** The :doc:`System` assumption:

  The code will run primarily on a GPU (the most limiting assumption in the development process).

.. rst-class:: centered

.. topic:: **2.** The :doc:`ParticleData` assumption:

  Simulations are based on the state of "particles" (whatever a particle and its state mean).

.. rst-class:: centered

.. topic:: **3.** The :doc:`Integrator </Integrator/index>` assumption:

  The state of these particles changes in time.

.. rst-class:: centered

.. topic:: **4.** The :doc:`Interactor </Interactor/index>` assumption:

  Particles can interact with each other and/or with an external influence.

A quick example:
=================

A brief example of how a code using UAMMD typically looks like. In this example  we have a simulation of non-interacting Brownian particles.

**UAMMD does not need to be compiled separatedly (it is header only).**

Some special flags might be needed to compile codes including with certain UAMMD headers, see Compiling UAMMD.
Here you have a short example of how a typical UAMMD code looks like:

.. code:: cpp

  //Ideal Brownian particles
  #include"uammd.cuh"
  #include"Integrator/BrownianDynamics.cuh"
  using namespace uammd;
  int main(){
    int numberParticles = 1e5;
    auto pd = make_shared<ParticleData>(numberParticles);
    {
      auto pos = pd->getPos(access::cpu, access::write);
      std::generate(pos.begin(), pos.end(),
                   [&](){ return make_real4(sys->rng.uniform3(-0.5, 0.5), 0);});
    }
    BD::EulerMaruyama::Parameters par;
    par.temperature = 1.0;
    par.viscosity = 1.0;
    par.hydrodynamicRadius = 1.0;
    par.dt = 0.1;
    auto bd = make_shared<BD::EulerMaruyama>(pd, par);
    int numberSteps=100;
    for(int i = 0; i<numberSteps; i++){
    	bd->forwardTime();
    }
    return 0;
  }

A plethora of guided examples are available in the repository.

About this documentation
===========================

An in depth theoretical description of most of the algorithms and physics behind UAMMD can be found in Raul's PhD manuscript, available here: https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/tesis/raw/main/manuscript.pdf

Although this documentation should be your primary source of knowledge for UAMMD, you should also consider the `old wiki <https://github.com/RaulPPelaez/UAMMD/wiki>`_. Although the wiki was written for older versions of UAMMD, it might shed some light if what you are trying to find is not here.
