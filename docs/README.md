## UAMMD documentation  

This is the source for the UAMMD documentation, currently hosted at readthedocs: https://uammd.readthedocs.io 

You can manually compile this documentation using [sphinx](sphinx-doc.org/). You can use pip to install the necessary dependencies:  

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

Afterwards, you can compile the docs in several formats. For instance, run ```make html``` to compile a web version (you can visualize it by opening ```_build/html/index.html```).
