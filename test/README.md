# UAMMD tests

Compile and run these examples with:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
#Solve any dependency issues raised by CMake
make test
```

Running these tests only requires the dependencies listed in the `environment.yml` in the root of the project.  

Refer to [this page of the documentation](https://uammd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tests.html) for more information.
